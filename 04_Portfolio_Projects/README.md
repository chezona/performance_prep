## Project 4: Systolic Array Utilization Analysis
**Week 23-24**
- Analyze tensor-core systolic array design
- Identify utilization bottlenecks
- Propose optimization strategies
- Compare with GPU SIMD approach

## Each Project Should Include

1. **README.md** - Overview and results
2. **Source code** - Well-commented implementation
3. **Performance analysis** - Graphs and metrics
4. **Architecture diagrams** - Visual explanations
5. **Optimization notes** - Detailed decisions

## Interview Story Format

For each project, prepare a 2-3 minute explanation:
1. Problem statement
2. Initial approach and bottleneck
3. Optimization technique applied
4. Results (with numbers)
5. Key insights learned

## Tips

- Focus on one project at a time
- Document as you go
- Keep code clean and commented
- Measure before and after
- Explain trade-offs clearly
